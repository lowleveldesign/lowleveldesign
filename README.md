### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In my GitHub repositories you may find tools and materials dedicated to system programming and software troubleshooting.

I also publish my work at **[wtrace.net](https://wtrace.net)** (troubleshooting tools and guides) and **[lowleveldesign.org](https://lowleveldesign.org)** (my blog).

I hope you find the materials informative and beneficial to your own projects.
