### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In my GitHub repositories you will find tools and materials dedicated to software troubleshooting.

**[Debug-recipes](https://github.com/lowleveldesign/debug-recipes)** contains my notes and guides collected during my various debugging challenges.

I also publish my work at **[wtrace.net](https://wtrace.net)** (troubleshooting tools and guires) and **[lowleveldesign.wordpress.com](https://lowleveldesign.wordpress.com)** (my blog).

I hope you find the materials informative and beneficial to your own projects.
